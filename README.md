# Design For Expression Team 5

This repository contains all design evidence for our Design-For-Expression project. 
Please add our Slack channel team5-expression to see time stamps for our design evidence 
for this project since many of the uploads to this repo were not uploaded immediately after
completion. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Brainstorming_Game_Ideas.jpg is an image of our notes from brainstorming existing games/
applications on the web that we could potentially use to remap the controls of the game
from keyboard/mouse to a 3D user interface using Leap Motion. We ultimately decided on 
designing for Fruit Ninja.

Wizard_Of_Oz_Testing.MOV is a video of us Wizard-of-Oz'ing our Fruit Ninja user interface
design.

The User_Testing_Iteration_1 folder contains videos of users interacting with our Fruit
Ninja Leap Motion user interface after its first iteration.
